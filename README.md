# Tsuro Tiles

Inspired by the (square) tiles in the game Tsuro which have two nodes on each side, and 4 paths connecting pairs of nodes, I decided to research how many possible such tiles there are. For ease, I started with triangles, and used a Jupyter notebook and Python to explore the possibilities.

## Instructions
First, install Python 3 and the VirtualEnv tool. On MacOS, this can be done using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), by issuing the command `brew install virtualenv`. 

**Note:** the commands below will differ for Windows, but a little perseverance should see you through.

Now, once you have cloned this repository or otherwise obtained a local copy of this source, run the following commands from the directory containing this README file:

- Create a Python virtual environment by running `virtualenv .venv`
- Enter this environment by running `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start the Jupyter Lab by running `jupyter lab`
- Follow the link in the output to open the lab in a browser, and navigate to the `main.ipynb` notebook.
- Read through the notebook, run the sections, and marvel at the amazing graphics.
